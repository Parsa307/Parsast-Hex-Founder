# Parsast Hex Founder

Parsast Hex Founder is a powerful tool designed to help users identify offsets and hexadecimal values in memory regions of Android applications. This project utilizes a vulnerability that MemoryPatch had to simplify the process of memory patching and modding.

## Features

- **Library Selection**: Scans and selects libraries within the target application, filtering out unwanted libraries.
- **Real-Time Value Detection**: Monitors memory values in real-time and detects changes.
- **Accurate Offset Calculation**: Computes offsets relative to the selected library, ensuring accurate results.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a clear interface for users to interact with, allowing them to save results, continue scanning, or exit the application.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Parsast-Hex-Founder.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Parsast-Hex-Founder
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in the script to use the tool.

## Usage

1. Launch the tool and select the library you wish to analyze.
2. The tool will automatically start detecting changes in the memory values of the selected library.
3. When changes are detected, offsets and corresponding hex values will be displayed.
4. You can choose to save the results, continue scanning, or exit the application.
